As the feature size of chips are decreaing, even a small particle of order of micrometer or nanometer is enough to cause malfunctions in the device. Thus, the device must be fabricated in a cleanroom where strict protocols are followed .
The first cleanroom technology was adopted by NASA, but it was inadequate for advanced chip fabrication. Cleanroom technology has thus evolved and must keep in pace with the upcoming chip manufacturing.
